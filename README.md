# My Awesome To-Do List App

Welcome to my To-Do List application! This project helps you keep track of your tasks and stay organized. I built this to practice my web development skills and create a useful tool for everyday productivity.

## What it does

This is a simple yet effective application where you can:

*   Add new tasks to your list.
*   Mark tasks as completed.
*   View all your pending and completed tasks.
*   (Maybe more features to come!)

## Getting Started

It's pretty easy to get this running on your local machine if you want to try it out or contribute.

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun) installed.

Then, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd to-do-list
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action!

## Technologies Used

This project is built with some cool modern web technologies:

*   **Next.js:** A fantastic React framework for building server-rendered applications.
*   **React:** For building the user interface components.
*   **(Potentially others as the project grows - e.g., a state management library, styling solution, etc.)**

I'm excited to keep working on this and making it even better!

## Want to contribute?

Feel free to fork the project, make some changes, and submit a pull request. Any contributions, big or small, are welcome!
